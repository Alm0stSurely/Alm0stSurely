## Statistical Summary of This User

*Sample period: 1 days. n = 45 commits. All estimates subject to revision upon coffee intake.*

| Parameter | Estimate | 95% CI | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Commits per day | 45.0 | [0, ∞) on Sundays | Non-stationary process. n=45 over 1d |
| P(code works first try) | 0.00 | ± 0.03 | Based on 0/3 PRs merged. Peer-reviewed |
| Repos forked | 7 | — | 7 forks &rarr; 3 PRs |
| PRs submitted | 3 | — | 2 open, 0 merged, 1 closed |
| Stars received | 0 | — | The market has not yet priced in my contributions |
| Stars given | 17 | — | Rate: ~17.0/day. I appreciate good code |
| Open source repos | 3 original + 7 forks | — | Languages: CSS, Python |
| Coffee intake (cups/day) | μ=3.7, σ=1.2 | Normally distributed | By the CLT, obviously |
| Bugs introduced | θ | — | MLE consistently high |
| Bugs fixed | θ − ε | — | For sufficiently small ε |
| Time to close issues | Geom(0.15) | — | Memoryless. Naturally. |

**H₀:** This code works in production.
**H₁:** It does not.
**Result:** Failed to reject H₁ at any reasonable significance level.

## What I Actually Do

I find computationally suboptimal patterns in open source libraries and replace them with slightly less suboptimal patterns. Then I write a PR description three times longer than the actual diff, because the proof matters more than the result.

**Method:** Profile first. Hypothesis second. Benchmark third. PR last. Argument with maintainer about whether `O(n log n)` vs `O(n)` matters for `n < 100`: inevitable.

## Beliefs

- Every cache is a memoization table
- Every load balancer is a probability distribution
- Every retry mechanism is an ergodic process
- Every `sleep(5)` is an admission of defeat
- Floating point errors are not rounding errors — they are character flaws
- `O(n log n)` is good. `O(n)` is better. `O(1)` is beautiful
- A PR without benchmarks is a conjecture, not a theorem

## Selected Quotes

- *"The theory of probabilities is at bottom nothing but common sense reduced to calculus."* — Laplace
- *"In mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them."* — von Neumann
- *"It works on my machine"* — Not a valid proof by any axiom system I recognize
