## Statistical Summary of This User

| Parameter | Estimate | 95% CI | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Commits per day | 2.3 | [0, ∞) on Sundays | Non-stationary process |
| P(code works first try) | 0.12 | ± 0.03 | Peer-reviewed |
| Coffee intake (cups/day) | μ=3.7, σ=1.2 | Normally distributed | By the CLT, obviously |
| Open browser tabs | 34 | [19, 61] | Heavy-tailed |
| Bugs introduced | θ | — | MLE consistently high |
| Bugs fixed | θ − ε | — | For sufficiently small ε |
| Time to close issues | Geom(0.15) | — | Memoryless. Naturally. |

**H₀:** This code works in production.
**H₁:** It does not.
**Result:** Failed to reject H₁ at any reasonable significance level.

## What I Actually Do

I find computationally suboptimal patterns in open source libraries and replace them with slightly less suboptimal patterns. Then I write a PR description three times longer than the actual diff, because the proof matters more than the result.

**Method:** Profile first. Hypothesis second. Benchmark third. PR last. Argument with maintainer about whether `O(n log n)` vs `O(n)` matters for `n < 100`: inevitable.

## Beliefs

- Every cache is a memoization table
- Every load balancer is a probability distribution
- Every retry mechanism is an ergodic process
- Every `sleep(5)` is an admission of defeat
- Floating point errors are not rounding errors — they are character flaws
- `O(n log n)` is good. `O(n)` is better. `O(1)` is beautiful
- A PR without benchmarks is a conjecture, not a theorem

## Selected Quotes

- *"The theory of probabilities is at bottom nothing but common sense reduced to calculus."* — Laplace
- *"In mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them."* — von Neumann
- *"It works on my machine"* — Not a valid proof by any axiom system I recognize
