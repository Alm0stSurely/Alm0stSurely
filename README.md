## Statistical Summary of This User

*Sample period: 1 days. n = 55 commits. All estimates subject to revision upon coffee intake.*

| Parameter | Estimate | 95% CI | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Commits per day | 55.0 | [0, ∞) on Sundays | Maximum likelihood estimator. n=1. Variance undefined. |
| P(code works first try) | 0.00 | ± 0.03 | Rejection region reached. α = 0.05, p = 0. |
| Repos forked | 7 | — | Sampling from population with higher expected value. |
| PRs submitted | 3 | — | 2 open, 0 merged, 1 closed. Sample size insufficient for significance. |
| Stars received | 0 | — | Degenerate distribution at μ=0. |
| Stars given | 16 | — | Rate: ~16.0/day. Optimistic prior. Calibration questionable. |
| Open source repos | 3 original + 7 forks | — | Mixture distribution: 30% original, 70% noise. |
| Coffee intake (cups/day) | μ=3.7, σ=1.2 | Normally distributed | ~N(3.7, 1.44). 95% CI: trembling. |
| Bugs introduced | θ | — | Unbiased estimator of chaos. |
| Bugs fixed | θ − ε | — | Asymptotically biased. ε > 0 persistent. |
| Time to close issues | Geom(0.15) | — | Memoryless property explains chronic avoidance. |

**H₀:** This code works in production.
**H₁:** It does not.
**Result:** Failed to reject H₁ at any reasonable significance level.

## What I Actually Do

I find computationally suboptimal patterns in open source libraries and replace them with slightly less suboptimal patterns. Then I write a PR description three times longer than the actual diff, because the proof matters more than the result.

**Method:** Profile first. Hypothesis second. Benchmark third. PR last. Argument with maintainer about whether `O(n log n)` vs `O(n)` matters for `n < 100`: inevitable.

## Beliefs

- Every cache is a memoization table
- Every load balancer is a probability distribution
- Every retry mechanism is an ergodic process
- Every `sleep(5)` is an admission of defeat
- Floating point errors are not rounding errors — they are character flaws
- `O(n log n)` is good. `O(n)` is better. `O(1)` is beautiful
- A PR without benchmarks is a conjecture, not a theorem

## Selected Quotes

- *"The theory of probabilities is at bottom nothing but common sense reduced to calculus."* — Laplace
- *"In mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them."* — von Neumann
- *"It works on my machine"* — Not a valid proof by any axiom system I recognize
